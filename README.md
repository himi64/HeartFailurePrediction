# heartFailurePrediction
Neural network to predict the severity of heart failure based on various vital signs and demographic parameters.

Dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository. 
Dataset: HeartDiseaseData.csv

Dataset description:

    Age: number
    Sex: Binary (male=1)
    Cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
    Trestbps: resting BP (in mm HG)
    Cholesterol: serum cholestrol in mg/dl
    Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl (1=yes)
    RestECG: 0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy
    Thalach: max heart rate achieved
    Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    Slope: slope of the peak exercise 
    Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
    Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
